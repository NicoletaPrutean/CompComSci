## Exercises

Before running any of the Python scripts, make sure to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt

This repository contains various Python .py scripts that primarily follow exercises and examples from the following resources:

This project is inspired by the book [Computational Social Science](https://cssbook.net/) and the [BDACA course](https://github.com/uvacw/teaching-bdaca/tree/main).

Some scripts may also be inspired by the topics covered in these sources, adapted or extended to explore different datasets or libraries.

Check the comments and docstrings within individual .py files for more context and explanations.
